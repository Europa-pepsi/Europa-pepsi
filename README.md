### 🌌 About My Journey
Greetings! I am **Roma**, a young developer from **Ukraine** 🇺🇦 who is deeply fascinated by the art of creating websites. 
At 13, I’ve decided to dive head-first into the world of **JavaScript**, turning logic into interactive experiences. 
Every line of code I write is a step toward building something meaningful.

I believe that programming is not just about syntax; it’s about solving puzzles 🧩 
and creating digital spaces where everyone feels welcome.

### 🐾 The "Paws-itive" Side of My Life
When the code editor is closed, you’ll find me spending quality time with my 
**cats and dogs**. They are my silent mentors and the best companions 
one could ask for while debugging a complex script. 🐱🐶

### ✍️ My Philosophy
*"Code is like art: it starts with a single stroke (or a bracket) and ends with a masterpiece."*
